# Measuring-Hadamard-States
Measuring |+> and |->.

Input: A qubit which is guaranteed to be in either the $$\ket +$$ state, or the $$\ket -$$ state.

Output: true if the qubit is in the $$\ket -$$ state, or false if it was in the $$\ket +$$ state. The state of the qubit at the end of the operation does not matter.
